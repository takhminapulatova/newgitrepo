    <h3>INSTRUCTIONS:</h3>
    <ol class="instructions">
        <li>Bring a large pot of water to a boil to cook the pasta. Once boiling, add the pasta and cook until al dente. Drain the pasta in a colander.</li>
        <li>While the pasta is cooking, prepare the sauce. Add the butter and minced garlic to a deep skillet or pot and saut√© over medium heat for 1-2 minutes,<br> or just until the garlic is soft and fragrant, but not brown.</li>
        <li>Turn the heat down to medium-low. Add the milk to the skillet along with the cream cheese (cut into chunks). Heat the milk and cream cheese while whisking,<br> until the cream cheese has fully melted into the milk.</li>
        <li>Whisk in the grated Parmesan cheese and continue to whisk as the sauce comes up to a gentle simmer. When it reaches a simmer, the sauce will thicken.<br> Turn the heat down to low to keep the sauce warm. Season the sauce with 1/4 tsp salt and a generous amount of freshly cracked pepper.</li>
        <li>Add the fresh spinach to the sauce and stir it in until it has wilted and become limp.</li>
        <li>Finally, add the cooked and drained pasta to the spinach alfredo sauce and stir to combine. Serve immediately.</li>
